# calculator

This repository contains the further implementation of the calculator that we began working on in Professor Kaiser's CSC 3380 course. I have added functionalities that support negative numbers, modulus operations, pre-defined symbolic values like "pi" and "e", and the ability for the user to declare variables for extended use.
